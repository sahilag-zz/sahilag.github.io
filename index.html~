	<section>
	<p>I am first year Master's student at CSE, UCSD. Previously I completed my Bachelors (and Masters) in Electrical Engineering from <a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in/">IIT Bombay</a>, India. </p>

	<p>I was born in Ahmedabad in India and have also lived in Vadodara, Pune and Mumbai. My parents hail from the populous state of Uttar Pradesh. I always get confused when I am asked the typical "Where are you from?" question. I end up giving this whole story. </p>

	<p>I personally believe that technology is making us all useless lumps; except the handful of people who use it their advantage (which might be a lot of poeple actually). So just me then?</p>

	<p>One question which troubles me a lot is: to be a Jack of all trades or a Master of one. Would one rather learn a music instrument, blog about philosophy, go hiking regularly and be a decent programmer making jolly good money; or just delve in Mathematics all day all night resurfacing occasionally to have a bath! </p>

	<h3>Serious research stuff</h3>

	<p> I am currently interested in Cryptography (self-proclaimed expert). I found it to be a perfect blend of mathematics, cool algorithmic stuff and apparent usefulness. Of course, I am just getting started.</p>
